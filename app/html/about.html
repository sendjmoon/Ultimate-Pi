  <h1> ABOUT </h1>
  <p>Ultimate Pi is an application inspired by a group of developers who share a curiosity towards technology. Our goal is to create a platform that acts as a bridge between a user and their device. This can commonly be referred to as a remote control but often times it can (and will be) misplaced. In the event of such unfortunate circumstance, Ultimate Pi's true potential is unleashed.</p>

  <p> By running a Node server on the Raspberry Pi, Ultimate Pi is able to provide a web interface allowing users to interact via HTTP requests to a REST API.</p>
