  <h1> ABOUT </h1>
  <p>Ultimate Pi is an application inspired by a group of developers who share a curiosity towards technology. Our goal is to create a platform that acts as a bridge between a user and their device. This can commonly be referred to as a remote control but often times it can (and will be) misplaced. In the event of such unfortunate circumstance, Ultimate Pi's true utility can be seen.</p>

  <p>By running a Node server on the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>, Ultimate Pi is able to provide a web interface allowing users to send infrared commands via HTTP requests to a REST API. Heroku is used to handle the HTTP requests that are then forwarded to the Pi directly.</p>

  <p>This project is only in it's beginning stages, but has the potential to reach extraordinary heights. In our <a href="#/features">features</a> page more information regarding our next steps can be found.</p>
